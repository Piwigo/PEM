Installation
============

1. extract files from the archive

2. place the source files on your website in the directory of your choice
   ("extensions" for example)

3. create the MySQL database (and optionally, a separate database user)

4. edit include/config_default.inc.php, setting the db_params to the
   correct database connection information

5. using the mysql client (or a web interface such as phpMyAdmin),
   create the tables, e.g.,

	mysql> source extensions/install/pem.sql

6. from your browser, go to the pem folder (e.g., "http://mysite/extensions")
   and register a user; you'll be logged in automatically upon successful
   registration

7. edit include/config_default.inc.php, adding '1' to the admin_users array
   (if you registered more than one user, lookup the corresponding id_user
    in the pem_users table)

	http://mysite/extensions/install/upgrade.php
